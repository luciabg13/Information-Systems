# Dreamhome
Backend of the Information Systems Project
Here, the Dreamhome database can be found.
Also, the commands to create the database, delete it, insert records and do some queries.

First steps:
To initialize the DB, it could be done directly in the SQLite Database with the SQLite Browser and the files in the SQL Code folder or running the script initdb.js, with the help of node.

To delete the DB, it could be done directly in the SQLite Database with the SQLite Browser and the files in the SQL Code folder or running the script dropdb.js, with the help of node.

There are some examples of queries and insertions in the SQL Code folder.

With this project, data from CSV can be loaded from the frontend to the Database, making it easy to import business data. Also, a model in the DB has been developed to meet the business requirements.
